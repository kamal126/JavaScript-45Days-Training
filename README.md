# JavaScript 45 Days Training

Welcome to my **JavaScript 45-Day Training Journey**! üöÄ

This repository is dedicated to my self-learning path, where I will be covering JavaScript topics from **beginner to expert level** over the course of 45 days. Each day, I will focus on a new topic, building up my knowledge step-by-step with practical code examples and explanations.

## Overview

- **Duration**: 45 Days
- **Goal**: Master JavaScript from scratch
- **Topics Covered**: From basic syntax, data types, functions, and DOM manipulation to advanced concepts like async/await, promises, closures, and complete projects.

## Directory Structure

Each day's work will be organized into separate directories, named as `Day-X-TopicName`:
